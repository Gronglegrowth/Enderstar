# Enderstar
A mod with an experimental artstyle about magical radiation and what came before, heavily inspired by, but not exactly the same as, EssentialCraft. Intended as a project to assist in my learning modding, and grew into a playground for ideas that... probably should not be in any sane mod.

You have come into possession of a textbook that has been significantly marked up by a previous owner, by digging around in mineshafts or monster rooms. Why did they discard it? What does this book - and your predecessor - teach? Was that a flash of green in the sky?!

Through this Radiagician's Primer you will discover the magic of radiation, and how to use it in tools, weaponry, and mechanisms, all presented in a unique hand-drawn 256x artstyle.
