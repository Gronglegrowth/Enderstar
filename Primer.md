# Introduction
For decades, the world's foremost experts on the nature of the atom have worked tirelessly __uh huh.__ to research the strange phenomenon the authors of these pages __and I__ have worked to document. You may have already felt its presence: [various examples here]. All of these and more are signs of a curious force we have only recently discovered and given a name to: radiagic.

The name is a portmanteau of "radiation" and "magic", as one may surmise. __how NOT clever.__ It is an unnatural property in the atom, and its origin is as of yet inexplicable. __no it isn't!__ This book seeks to enlighten the gentle reader on this force, this radiagic, and inspire them as to potential applications and future developments. 

__As you might already have noticed I will also be providing additional commentary and context for this book, context that the authors... did not have.__

# Section I: The Elemental Bases

## Introduction
Like the alchemists and wizards of yore, we begin our study of this radioactive magic by focusing on the classical ~~Four~~ __5__ Elements: fire, water, earth, and air __+ magic__. Objects associated with each element appear to embody a core property of radiagic, the base of all other things as it were. __close enough__

## Elemental Condensate
To start one's studies, it is necessary to first acquire condensed samples of these elements. The procedure to do so is straightforward, but is not as simple as mere crafting.

We begin by preparing a mixture known as Assembly Powder. It is a blend of one part glowstone, two parts redstone, and one part sugar. __better way: 1xGlow 1xReds 1xMith__ To use, simply sprinkle in the center of a valid pattern of blocks, or enlist dispensers to do so for you.

The next step is aformentioned patterns of blocks. There are four patterns the eager student need remember right now, listed on the following pages. Their usage is quite straightforward, as aforementioned: toss as much of the element's requisite item (listed alongside its corresponding pattern) into the center of the pattern as you desire, then sprinkle Assembly Powder on top.

After the practitioner has acquired the four condensed samples, they can then simply combine all four together to receive Elemental Condensate, a substance that represents all the elements at once.

the following four pages are all in this format:

[item] = [condensate amount]

## Matrices and MRU
[some anecdote on ritual sacrifice and its importance across many cultures across history]

All life, no matter its place on any chain or hierarchy, contains a measure of radiagic __amount is based on its healthiness__ within it. These are Matrices. We theorize them to sit around the heart, like an intangible shield protecting it from radiation-based harm. The strength of one's Matrix is quantifiable, and a device to measure it exists called the Soul Stone.

To create the Soul Stone, one need construct and use a block pattern similar to how we create condensed elements. The pattern is listed on the last page.

Seeing one's matrix with this object is simple: holding it with sufficient intent to **use** it appears to bind it to its holder. If done correctly, some lines of text will appear floating above its surface when one inspects it, visible only to its bearer. The text describes the balance and quantity of MRU - Magical Radiation Units, a measure of Radiagic - within the matrix. Balance is a quality of all radiagic, and describes how fast or slow the radiation particles in the atoms are moving. Frozen (0.0) is the slow extreme. Chaotic (2.0) is the fast extreme. Between them exist Magic (1.5), ...
